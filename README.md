# PlatformFramework
Modified movement, platforming, and dash framework from [>_TER]RAFORM. Full game is still under development, but a demo is playable here: https://skyenxt.itch.io/terraform
Common controls are below (found in `PlayerMovement.cs`):
 - Movement: Left/Right Arrow
 - Jump: Up Arrow
 - Dash: Space
Controls specific to [>_TER]RAFORM are below:
 - Temporary Platform: Left Shift
 - Destroy: X (you won't be able to see this one in action in this framework)

Background pulsing and music are also included, but that was mainly because I was too lazy to take it out.
